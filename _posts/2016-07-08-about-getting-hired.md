title: About getting hired - Junior positions
---

If people in software professions talk about getting hired, they tend to get
very opinionated.

Any developer can tell you stories of being hounded by more or
less competent recruiters, some people will share their stories how recruiting is
supposedly completely merciless and yet others seem to ascend to a junior position with
minimal experience and training.

I’d like to start a little series on how hiring works at betterplace.org, and
in general, so that things get a little less mystifying for everyone involved.

As the topic is broad, we’ll tackle it one step at a time.

# Part one: Your first junior position

If you are new to the trade - especially if you’re not originally from a
"techie background" - you’re probably wondering what it takes to get that first
job in development.

## Good news: We want you

Software developers are in high demand.

This is especially good for junior
people who come from different walks of life. For you it means that recruiters
have more time per resume, and it is less likely that you’re filtered out
solely on formal criteria (e.g. "has no degree").

It also means that there are more companies willing to train you on the job (as
experienced people are hard to come by).

Make no mistake, though: I’d still encourage you to get all the education you
can get - if you’re fresh out of school by all means do enroll in college and
get that degree! (Prefer a
[practice-oriented program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2o282JIr_E), though,
unless you'd like to go into research...)

## What is required to get started?

Even though the "formal" requirements are quite relaxed right now, any
company hiring you _will_ have "hard" requirements on what they need from
new recruits.

At betterplace these go something like:

* **You are able to program.** And by that we mean that your are able to take
a description of a problem and formulate a solution in code. A lot of our
interviewing is about finding out just that.
* **You understand the _basics_ of the "theory"** behind software development.
In our daily work we deal with stuff like objects, classes, exceptions,
inheritance, network protocols and so on. _You don’t need to be an expert_ on
those things yet, but you need to have a basic idea of what those are and why
they exist.
* **We want you on our team**. Don't get me wrong: This does **not** mean you
have to be "just like us". We do welcome diversity - both in background and
in approach.
Once we hire you, we will be around each other for hours every day. We will have
to review your code, live with your decisions and you with ours.
Thus we need to trust that we'll have respectful and productive
interactions with you in the long run.

Other places have other priorities - but any sane company will put those into
their job descriptions.

### And if I don’t meet the requirements?

**First off, don’t give up just yet.** Chances are
that as a "junior" person, you fall into one of two groups:

1. You just wrote your small app. You are amazed how easy that was, you are
really excited about the things you can achieve and you think you’ll be
able to do anything and everything within no time.
2. **Or:** You already learned a lot. You have also learned that there are many
things you don’t know yet, and that some problems are just _hard_. You may
experience some self-doubt ’cause you’re not so sure if you’ll ever be as good as
the folks you learn from.

In case one, just take a deep breath and take a reality check.
It’s great that you just took your first step into the world of software,
but there’s probably a lot to learn for you. The world will still be there when
you are ready.

In the second case you’re probably doing better than you think you are. So don’t
throw in the towel.

If you have a mentor, you may just want to get some honest feedback from her or
him about where you stand.

And even if you’re not ready _yet_, remember: Developing software is a skill you
can learn, not an innate ability. It just takes dedicated work (and a lot
of practice) to succeed.

## How do I apply?

The first step is dead simple. You just send us an email explaining why
you want to work for us and what you can do, your CV and _a link to some
code that you wrote_ (e.g. github).

Formalities include:

* Your email is your "cover" letter. No need for a separate document, really
* Your CV should be attached as a PDF. We don’t really enjoy dealing with weird
file formats, or having to visit the "CV web page" you spent so much time on
* The CV should be structured like a standard CV
* We don’t really need your picture, your marital status or your parents’
occupation. We will also skip any motivational blurb you chose to put into
your CV
* We **do** want to know why you chose to apply to betterplace.org
* If you’re not a native speaker, we’d like to know how good your German
and/or English language skills are

## What happens next?

When we receive your application, you’ll get a friendly email that we received
it. Then we will review your application and your github repo (or other code
you sent). We may get in touch via email if there are open questions.

If we like your application, you will move on to a first Skype interview and
eventually to the technical interviews. But this is stuff for another blog post.

## When do I hear back from you?

We are aware that you're probably holding your breath. Especially if this is your
first job. And you'll immediately get a friendly confirmation that we received your
application.

Don't be overly concerned if, after that, we take a little while to get back to
you. We are just a small team, and we have to make time to review your code and
CV.

Still, if at any time you feel like we have forgotten you, just ask us for an
update.

The same goes if you _really_ need quick feedback (e.g. you have to make
a decision by day x). We will try our best to speed things up in that case.

## What **not** to do...

Even though we are happy about every application, there are a few things that’ll
quickly get you kicked out of the process:

* **Don't be generic**. _"To whom it may concern"_ is **not**
something that gets you off to a good start: Your applications are read by an
actual person. Her name is Claudia. And if you had actually read our job posting
you would know that. Why should we be interested in you if you’re not even
interested in sending us a personalized email? Applications that look like
copied and pasted just make you look bad.
* **Don't copy and paste into your github repositories**. We very much look into the
code that you have on github. After all, your coding is a major part of why we want hire you.
We like your repo to be authentic. Which means it should be clear from the
git history what your contributions are, and what you got from elsewhere. It is
totally fine to fork someones code and improve it, and to collaborate on code.
Just _never_ copy stuff from other repos, or from Stackoverflow, or wherever
and check it in under your own name.
* **Don't use an inappropriate format or tone**. For example: Emails that contain
nothing except "Hi I’m Al. Saw your job posting. Just contact me on
skype if you’re interested." are not going to generate much interest, to put it mildly.

## What _we_ don’t do

There are some things that people are often annoyed or scared about, that we
won’t do to you:

* **Ask brainteaser questions** Actually, nobody in their sane mind uses those any
more. We _will_ ask simple coding questions during our Skype interviews, but
nothing with pirates, goats or foxes.

* **Whiteboard coding** Yes, we _will_ have you do coding exercises.
We _will_ also expect you to use a whiteboard or paper to explain things. But we
will not force you to develop code only with a whiteboard or paper.
You may jot down code if you chose to, but you’ll always have the option to use
a proper editor and run the code you write.

 It's well worth to check out their site. They offer a lot of insights into their
 hiring process. And even if it is different from ours (or that of other
 companies) much of it applies in general.
