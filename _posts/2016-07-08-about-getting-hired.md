title: About getting hired - Junior positions
---

If people in software professions talk about getting hired, they tend to get
very opinionated.

Any developer can tell you stories of being hounded by more or
less competent recruiters, some people will share their stories how recruiting is
supposedly completely and yet others seem to ascend to a junior position with
minimal experience and training.

I'd like to start a little series on how hiring works at betterplace.org, and
in general, so that things get a little less mystifying for everyone involved.

As the topic is broad, we'll tackle it one step at a time

# Part one: Your first junior position

If you are new to the trade - especially if your not originally from a
"techie background" - your probably wondering what it takes to get that first
job in development.

## Good news: We want you

Software developers are in high demand.

This is especially good for junior
people who come from different walks of life. For you it means that recruiters
have more time per resume, and it is less likely that you're filtered out
solely on formal criteria (e.g. "has no degree").

It also means that there are more companies willing to train you on the job (as
experienced people are hard to come by).

(Make no mistake, though: I'd still encourage you to get all the education you
can ge - if you're fresh out of school by all means do enroll in college and
get that degree!)

## What is required to get started?

Even though the "formal" requirements are quite relaxed right now, each
company hiring you _will_ have "hard" requirements on what they need from
new recruits.

At betterplace these go something like:

* **You are able to program.** And by that we mean that your are able to take
a description of a problem and formulate a solution in code. A lot of our
interviewing is about finding out just that.
* **You understand the _basics_ of the "theory"** behind software development.
In our daily work we deal with stuff like objects, classes, exceptions,
inheritance, network protocols and so on. _You don't need to be an expert_ on
those things yet, but you need to have a basic idea of what those are and why
they exist.
* **We would like to work with you on our team**. If we hire you we will be
around each other for hours each day. We will have to review your code and live
with your decisions. That means you'll only move on if we have a good feeling
about having you on board.

Other places have other priorities - but any sane company will put those into
their job descriptions.

### And if I don't make the cut?

First off, don't just give up after reading the job requirements. Chances are
that as a junior you fall into on of two groups:

* You just wrote your small app. You are amazed how easy that was, you are
really excited about the things you can achieve and you think you'll be
able to do anything and everything within no time.
* Or you already learned a lot. You have also learned that there are so many
things you don't know yet, and that some problems are just _hard_. You may
experience some self-doubt 'cause you're not so sure if you'll can as good as
the folks you learn from.

In the first case, just take a deep and a reality check. It's great that you
just took your first step into the world of software, but there's probably a
lot to learn.

In the second case you're probably doing better than you think you are. So don't
throw in the towel.

If you have a mentor, you may just want to get some honest feedback from her or
him about where you stand.

And even if you're not ready _yet_, remember: Developing software is a skill you
can learn, not an innate ability. It just takes dedicated work (and a lot
of practice) to succeed.

## How do I apply?

The basic process is dead simple. You just send us an email explaining why
you want to work for us and what you can do, your CV and a link to some
code that you wrote (e.g. github).

Formalities include:

* Your email is your "cover" letter. No need for a separate document, really
* Your CV should be attached as a PDF. We don't really enjoy dealing with weird
file formats, or having to visit the "CV web page" you spent so much time on
* The CV should be structured like a standard CV
* We don't really need your picture, your marital status or your parents'
occupations. We will also skip any motivational blurb you chose to put into
your CV.
* We **do** want to know why you chose to apply to betterplace.org
* If you're not a native German, we'd like to know how good your German
and/or English language skills are

## What happens next?

When we receive your application, you'll get a friendly email that we received
it. Then we will review your application and your github repo (or other code
you sent). We may get in touch via email if there are open questions.

If we like your application, you will move on to a first Skype interview and
eventuell to the technical interviews. But this is stuff for another blog post.

## What **not** to do...

Even though we are happy about ever application, there are a few things that'll
quickly get you kicked out of the process:

### Generic copy-and-paste applications

"To whom it may concern" is **not**
something that gets you off to a good start: Your applications are read by an
actual person. Her name is Claudia. And if you had actually read our job posting
you would know that. Why should we be interested in you if you're not even
interested in sending us a personalized email?

This includes clicking the "apply" button in Linkedin. Just don't do that.

### Pimp your github repo

There are a lot of ways to "find" code on the interweb
that you can use in your projects. If you do that and (without being open about
it) there's a good chance we'll find out and not take kindly to it.
And even if not: You'll have just successfully set yourself up to fail
in an interview.

### Use an inappropriate format or tone

Emails that contain nothing except
"Hi I'm Bob. Saw your job posting. Just contact me on skype if your interested."
are not going to generate much interest, to put it mildly.

## What _we_ don't do

There are some things that people are often annoyed or scared about, that we
won't do to you:

### Ask brainteaser questions

Actually, nobody in their sane mind uses those any more. We _will_ ask simple
coding questions during our Skype interviews, but nothing with pirates, goats
or foxes.

### Whiteboard coding

We _will_ have you do coding exercises. We _will_ expect you to use a whiteboard
or paper to explain things.

But we will not force you to develop code only with a whiteboard or paper.
You may jot down code if you chose to, but you'll always have the option to use
a proper editor and run the code you write.
